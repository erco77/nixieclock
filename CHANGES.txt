1.66 -- Convert to git/github, GPL2 -> GPL3

1.65 -- ??.??.??

    o Applied Alexander Clouter's #include and Makefile mods

1.64 -- 04/10/12

    o Restored lemon's '-c <epoch>' flag to enable 'beer o'clock' countdown
      (See -help and man page for examples of how to use)

    o Added the -N flag to help the -c <epoch> flag from affecting
      the ~/.nixieclock file.

    o tar file now has version number in the extraction
      (eg. extracts as "./nixieclock-<VERSION#>/*")

1.63 -- 03/15/12 [INTERNAL RELEASE]
    o Changed 3dsite.com -> seriss.com

    o Added 'ENVIRONMENT' section to docs re: TZ variable (for Terry).
      Example shows how to use TZ to show the time in GMT.

    o Added small fixes to support mingw from Terry

    o FLTK added to help screen (LGPL/FLTK license compliance)

1.62 -- 11/28/11 [INTERNAL RELEASE]
    o Fix for Daniel Ott regarding Fl::args() parsing issue;
      parse_args() wasn't returning word count.

    o Added docs for -m (flag was recognized but not documented)

    o Added -D flag: same as -d, but with 4 digit year (13:59 12/31/1999)

    o Removed some extraneous code

1.61 -- 06/08/11

    o Fixed a silly bug that made clock redraw itself waaay too often
      and used too much cpu

1.60 -- 05/05/11

    o Added right click popup menu to set various time formats.
      For macs with single-button mice, Ctrl-Click will popup the menu.

    o Clock settings now saved in a ~/.nixieclock file
      so that e.g. clock will come up in same position 
      it was last moved to, and same time format it was last
      set to.

    o Fixed command line help menu

    o When time formats are adjusted, clock maintains
      distance to closest edge of screen.

    o Added '%', '&' and '|' characters to NixieDisplay.

    o nixie-text-viewer: added Home and End keys.
      Added tooltip to show supported navigation keys.

    o (INTERNAL) Reorg'ed clock code into a 'NixieClock' class
      in order to implement popup menu features.

    o (INTERNAL) Reformatted code for 'fltk style' braces
      which makes code a bit shorter for easy reading.

    o (INTERNAL) Had to rename nixieclock.C -> nixieclock-app.C
      to avoid conflict with NixieClock vs. nixieclock on platforms
      that don't care about case >:/

1.51 -- 02/10/10

    o Added #include <stdio.h> to top of nixie-text-display.C

	 o -Wno-write-strings

    o Fixed '9'

    o Added nixie-text-display to default build

1.49 -- 10/27/09

    o For OSX, made 'nofork' default to on, to prevent these errors
      when running on OSX 10.5 and up:

	The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation functionality safely. You MUST exec().
	Break on __THE_PROCESS_HAS_FORKED_AND_YOU_CANNOT_USE_THIS_COREFOUNDATION_FUNCTIONALITY___YOU_MUST_EXEC__() to debug.
